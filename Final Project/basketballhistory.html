                    <ul>
                        <li>Basketball was invented by Dr. James Naismith in 1891 at a YMCA in Springfield, Massachusetts.</li>
                        <li>Naismith wanted to create a game that could be played indoors during the winter months, and he hung peach baskets as goals at each end of the gym.</li>
                        <li>Since then, basketball has evolved into a globally popular sport, played at both amateur and professional levels.</li>
                        <li>Important milestones in basketball history include the establishment of the National Basketball Association (NBA) in 1946 and the introduction of the three-point line in 1979.</li>
                    </ul>
