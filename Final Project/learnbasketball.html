                <h2>Basic Rules:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Basketball is played between two teams, each aiming to score points by shooting the ball through the opponent's hoop.</li>
                    <li>Each team consists of five players on the court at a time.</li>
                    <li>Points are scored by making field goals worth two or three points, depending on the distance from the hoop, or free throws worth one point.</li>
                    <li>Players are not allowed to run while holding the ball (travelling), double dribble, or push other players.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>Techniques:</h2>
                <h3>Shooting:</h3>
